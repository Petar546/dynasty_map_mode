Mod which is going to add dynasty map mode in ck3 as the house map mode which currently exists
Plans are to make the name show up as it does for houses
optional is to make other smaller less significant members of your own dynasty also show up
color only your own dynasty?
what about if you want to check ofther dynasties then?
